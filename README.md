# Culture Wall
http://culturewall.herokuapp.com/

## Usage

Create a Wall and link it to your team. You can add values and vote on them collaboratively.

Voting is deliberately left unrestricted. If you want to vote up a value twenty times because you _really_ like it, that's part of the point.

## Tech

Culture Wall is a dead-simple Sinatra app, using sqlite in development and postgres in production. The CSS and JS is vanilla. This would work well as a React app but would also work well as a Rails app. Choosing simpler, more do-it-yourself options was deliberate.
